Got it 👍 Let’s keep it **super simple** and only focus on **application deployment objects** you’ll need for your **3-tier ecommerce app** (frontend + backend + database). No cluster setup, just what goes inside Kubernetes once you already have kubeadm cluster running.

## 🛠️ Roadmap for 3-Tier App Deployment (Easy View)

### 1. **Namespace**

* Create a separate space for your app.
  👉 Example: `ecommerce`

---

### 2. **Database Layer (MySQL)**

* **StatefulSet** → Runs MySQL with stable Pod identity.
* **Service (ClusterIP, headless)** → Lets backend connect to DB.
* **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)** → Keeps DB data safe across Pod restarts.
* **Secret** → Store DB root/user password.
* **ConfigMap (optional)** → MySQL configs if needed.

---

### 3. **Backend Layer (API Service)**

* **Deployment** → Runs multiple replicas of backend service.
* **Service (ClusterIP)** → Internal stable endpoint to expose backend to frontend.
* **ConfigMap** → Non-sensitive configs (like DB host).
* **Secret** → Sensitive info (like DB password).
* **HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA)** → Auto-scale backend when traffic grows.
* **NetworkPolicy** → Only allow backend Pods to talk to DB service.

---

### 4. **Frontend Layer (UI)**

* **Deployment** → Runs frontend Pods.
* **Service (LoadBalancer / NodePort)** → Expose frontend internally/externally.
* **Ingress** → Map domain (e.g. `ecommerce.com`) → frontend service.

---

### 5. **Operational Add-ons (Production-like)**

* **CronJob** → Schedule tasks (e.g., DB backup).
* **DaemonSet** → Logging/monitoring agents on every node.
* **ResourceQuota & LimitRange** → Prevent one app from consuming all resources.

---

## 📌 Final Easy Flow (How traffic moves)

1. User hits → **Ingress** (domain)
2. Ingress → **Frontend Service** → **Frontend Pods**
3. Frontend → **Backend Service** → **Backend Pods**
4. Backend → **MySQL Service** → **MySQL StatefulSet Pod** + **PVC**

Along the way:

* **ConfigMaps + Secrets** inject configs and credentials.
* **HPA** scales backend when load increases.
* **NetworkPolicy** secures DB from unwanted access.

⚡ In real world, this covers **95% of objects you’ll use** for such an app.

Do you want me to now **draw this same roadmap as a simple colored diagram** (no YAML, just blocks showing layers and objects)?

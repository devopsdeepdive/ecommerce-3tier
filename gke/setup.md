Perfect 👍 You want to create a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster from the GCP Console (GUI) using your free account. I’ll guide you step by step:

🚀 Steps to Create GKE Cluster in GCP Console (GUI)
Step 1: Login to GCP Console

Go to Google Cloud Console
.

Make sure you are logged in with your free account (with $300 credits).

At the top, select or create a Project (each cluster belongs to a project).

Step 2: Enable GKE API

In the left-hand navigation menu, search for Kubernetes Engine.

Click Kubernetes Engine → Clusters.

The first time, it will ask you to Enable the Kubernetes Engine API.

Click Enable.

Wait a minute for APIs to be activated.

Step 3: Create a Cluster

Click Create Cluster.

You’ll see different options:

Standard Cluster (you manage nodes) ✅ Recommended

Autopilot Cluster (Google manages everything, but sometimes more costly)

👉 Since you’re on free trial, choose Standard (to avoid autopilot billing surprises).

Step 4: Configure Cluster Basics

Name: e.g., my-gke-cluster.

Location type:

Zonal → runs in one zone (cheaper, good for free trial).

Regional → runs across multiple zones (higher availability, but more expensive).

Pick Zonal, then choose your preferred zone (e.g., us-central1-a).

Step 5: Configure Node Pool

Default Node Pool will appear.

Click default-pool to edit:

Machine type → choose e2-micro or e2-small (to stay in free tier).

Nodes → set to 1 or 2 nodes only.

Save changes.

⚠️ Avoid big machine types, or your free credits will finish quickly.

Step 6: Networking (Optional for now)

Keep default VPC network and subnet.

Leave other options as default.

Step 7: Create

Click Create.

It will take 5–10 minutes for the cluster to be provisioned.

Step 8: Connect to Cluster

Once created, click your cluster → Connect button.

It will show you a gcloud command like:

gcloud container clusters get-credentials my-gke-cluster --zone us-central1-a --project PROJECT_ID


Copy and run that command in Cloud Shell (top-right button in console).

Step 9: Verify Cluster

Run inside Cloud Shell:

kubectl get nodes


You should see 1 or 2 nodes in Ready state ✅.

✅ Now your GKE cluster is ready, and you can start deploying apps with kubectl.

1. Namespace

Create a dedicated space to isolate your app.
👉 Example: ecommerce

apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: ecommerce
